If you want to add a new js plugin to be used with Knoboo, you need to:

1) Make a minified version of the file like so:
    $ ../../external/jsmin.py < jquery.SOME-PLUGIN.js > jquery.SOME-PLUGIN.min.js

2) The go to the file 'knoboo/scripts/jscompile.py' and add the file to that script.

* TODO: Generalize the above operations. *
